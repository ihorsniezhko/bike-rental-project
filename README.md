## Project Features

* **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out. The application uses `django-allauth` for handling authentication.

* **Bike Listings**: A list of available bikes is displayed on the homepage. Users can sort the bikes by name, type, size, price, and rating.

* **Bike Details**: Each bike has a detail page with more information, including a description, its availability status, and user reviews.

* **User Profiles**: Each user has a profile page that displays their active rentals and rental history.

* **Rental System**: Authenticated users can rent available bikes. The system tracks active and past rentals.

* **Review and Rating System**: Users can leave reviews and ratings for bikes they have rented. The average rating for each bike is displayed on the bike listing and detail pages.

## Project Management

The development of this project was managed using a GitHub Projects board. The board was used to track user stories, tasks, and progress through a Kanban-style workflow.

* [**View the Project Board on GitHub**](https://github.com/users/ihorsniezhko/projects/5)

## User Stories

The following user stories were used to guide the development of this project:

### User Perspective
* **As a new user,** I want to sign up for an account using my first name, last name, and date of birth, so that my profile is personalized and the service can verify my age eligibility.
* **As a user,** I want to find an available bike, view its details, rent it for a period, and then return it through my personal profile so that I can easily use the rental service and track my activity.
* **As a user who has rented a bike,** I want to leave a rating and a written review on the bike's detail page so that I can share my experience and help other users make informed decisions.

### Administrator Perspective
* **As a site administrator,** I want to be able to add, edit, and delete bikes from the inventory through the admin panel so that I can manage the products available for rent.
* **As a site administrator,** I want to view and moderate user-submitted reviews so that I can maintain a safe and appropriate community environment.
* **As a site administrator,** I want to view all user accounts and rental records so that I can oversee the platform's activity and assist users with issues.

### Developer & Stakeholder Perspective
* **As a developer,** I want to configure an automated deployment pipeline by connecting the project's GitHub repository to Heroku, so that I can deploy the application reliably.
* **As a project stakeholder,** I want a comprehensive `README.md` file that clearly explains the project's purpose, features, and setup process, so that I can quickly understand and contribute to the application.
* **As a site administrator,** I want to localize the site for a European audience and implement branding and initial content, so that the website feels professional and ready for testing.

## Wireframes

The wireframes for this project were created to establish a simple and clear structure for each page, focusing on user flow and element placement.

* Balsamiq Wireframes [BMPR](/static/media/bike-rentals-project.bmpr)
* Balsamiq Wireframes [PDF](/static/media/bike-rentals-project.pdf)

* **Homepage Wireframe:**
    * **Header:** Contains the logo, site name, and navigation links (Login/Signup or Profile/Logout).
    * **Main Content:** A main heading "Available Bikes" is followed by an introductory paragraph. Below this, a grid of bike cards is displayed. Each card contains a placeholder for an image, the bike's name, key details (type, size, price), and a "View Details" button.
    * **Footer:** A simple footer with basic site information.

* **Bike Detail Page Wireframe:**
    * **Header & Footer:** Consistent with the homepage.
    * **Main Content:** A two-column layout. The left column is dedicated to a large image of the bike. The right column contains the bike's name, a list of its key details, the price, and a prominent "Rent Now" button. Below this, a section is reserved for the bike's detailed description.
    * **Reviews Section:** Below the main content, another two-column layout displays existing user reviews on the left and a review submission form on the right for authenticated users.

* **Login / Sign Up Page Wireframe:**
    * **Header & Footer:** Consistent with the homepage.
    * **Main Content:** A single, centered content block containing a form. The form has a clear heading ("Login" or "Sign Up") and placeholders for the required input fields (username, password, etc.). A primary submission button is at the bottom of the form.

* **User Profile Page Wireframe:**
    * **Header & Footer:** Consistent with the homepage.
    * **Main Content:** A single-column layout with a welcome message for the user. The page is divided into two clear sections: "Active Rentals" and "Rental History". Each rental is displayed in its own card, with active rentals showing a "Return Bike" button.

## Frontend Design and User Experience (UX)

The frontend of this project was designed with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and responsiveness, primarily using the **Bootstrap 5** framework. The goal was to create a clean and intuitive user interface without the need for complex custom styling, which is a common approach for a project where the backend logic is the main focus.

* **Overall Structure:**
    * A consistent **Header** and **Footer** are used across all pages, which are defined in the `base.html` template. This ensures a predictable navigation experience for the user.
    * The main content of each page is wrapped in a Bootstrap `container`, which provides appropriate padding and centers the content on larger screens.
    ![Bike Rental Project Overall Structure](/static/media/overall.png)

* **Header:**
    * The header uses a standard Bootstrap `navbar`. It includes the site logo and brand name on the left.
    * The navigation links on the right are dynamic: they show "Login" and "Sign Up" for logged-out users, and "My Profile" and "Logout" for authenticated users. This is achieved with Django's template logic (`{% if user.is_authenticated %}`).
Â  Â  * On smaller screens, the navigation links collapse into a hamburger menu to ensure a mobile-friendly experience.
    ![Site Header](/static/media/header.png)

* **Homepage:**
    * The layout is built on Bootstrap's **grid system** (`<div class="row">`).
    * Available bikes are displayed in a series of Bootstrap `card` components. This is a simple and effective way to present items in a list.
    * On larger screens, the cards appear in a three-column grid. On smaller screens (like mobile), Bootstrap's responsive grid automatically stacks the cards into a single column, ensuring the site is mobile-friendly.
    ![Bike Rental Project Homepage](/static/media/homepage.png)

* **Bike Detail Page:**
    * This page uses a two-column layout. The main bike image is in a larger left-hand column, giving it prominence.
    * Key information (type, size, price) and the main call-to-action ("Rent Now" button) are in the right-hand column for easy access.
    * The user reviews and the review submission form are placed below the main content, clearly separating the primary information from secondary user-generated content.
    ![Bike Detail Page](/static/media/bike-detail.png)

* **Forms (Login/Signup):**
    * All forms are centered on the page and placed within a `card` to create a clean, focused area for user input.
    * The forms are rendered using the `django-crispy-forms` package with the `crispy-bootstrap5` template pack. This ensures that all form fields, labels, and error messages are automatically styled according to Bootstrap 5 standards, providing a consistent look and feel.
    ![User Sign Up](/static/media/user-signup.png)
    ![User Login](/static/media/user-login.png)

* **Profile Page:**
    * This page has a simple, single-column layout.
    * Clear headings (`<h4>`) are used to separate "Active Rentals" from "Rental History".
    * Each rental record is displayed in its own `card`, making the information easy to read and scan.
    ![User Profile](/static/media/user-profile.png)

* **Django Admin Interface:**
    * The standard Django admin panel is used for all backend content management.
    * The interface has been customized to improve usability; for example, the `Review` and `Bike` models use the `django-summernote` widget for their text fields, providing a rich-text editing experience.
    * This allows the site administrator to easily add new bikes, manage user accounts, and moderate reviews without needing to write code.

### Automated Testing

Automated tests are implemented using Django's built-in testing framework and Jest for frontend JavaScript.

* **Backend Tests**:
  * `reviews/tests.py`: Contains tests for the `Review` model and the `DeleteReview` view. These tests ensure that reviews are created correctly, that ratings are validated, and that users can delete their own reviews.
  * `rentals/tests.py`: Includes tests for the `create_rental` view. These tests verify that authenticated users can rent available bikes and that users with active rentals cannot rent another bike.

* **Frontend Tests**:
  * `static/js/star-rating.test.js`: Contains Jest tests for the star rating component on the review form. These tests ensure that the star rating functionality works as expected, including initialization, user interaction (clicking and hovering), and updating the hidden input value.

### Code Validation

#### Python Linter (Flake8)
All Python code was checked for errors and adherence to the PEP 8 style guide using the **Flake8** linter in Visual Studio Code. No errors were reported.

#### W3C Validators
The HTML and CSS files were validated to ensure they meet the latest web standards.
* **HTML:** All HTML pages were validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).
* **CSS:** The `style.css` file was validated using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

## Deployment

### Local Setup

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository:**
   First, fork the [original repository](https://github.com/ihorsniezhko/bike-rental-project.git) to your own GitHub account. Then, clone your forked repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/bike-rental-project.git](https://github.com/your-username/bike-rental-project.git)
   cd bike-rental-project
   ```

2. **Create the Database:**
   Navigate to the [Code Institute database page](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/) to create your PostgreSQL database. You will receive the `DATABASE_URL` via email.

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   * Create a file named `env.py` in the root directory of the project.
   * Add `env.py` to your `.gitignore` file to ensure it's not committed to version control.
   * In `env.py`, add your secret variables:
     ```python
     import os
     
     os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "your-database-url-from-email")
     os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "your-own-strong-secret-key")
     os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "your-cloudinary-url")
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install all required packages from the `requirements.txt` file.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run Migrations and Create Superuser:**
   Apply the database migrations to create the necessary tables and create an admin user.
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Run the Application Locally:**
* Before running the server, ensure that `DEBUG = True` is set in your `settings.py` file. This is crucial for local development as it enables detailed error pages and allows the development server to handle static files automatically.
* Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
* Remember to set `DEBUG = False` before deploying to a production environment like Heroku.
### Heroku Deployment

1.  **Install WhiteNoise:**
    WhiteNoise allows your application to serve its own static files in production.
    ```bash
    pip install whitenoise
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Update `settings.py` for Static Files:**
    In your `bike_rental/settings.py` file, make the following changes:
    * Add `whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware` to your `MIDDLEWARE` list, right after the `SecurityMiddleware`.
    * Define `STATIC_ROOT`.

    ```python
    # settings.py

    MIDDLEWARE = [
        'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
        'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',  # Add this line
        'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
        'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
        # ... other middleware
    ]

    # ... at the bottom of the file, with other static file settings
    STATIC_URL = '/static/'
    STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'), ]
    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
    ```

3. **Prepare for Deployment:**
   * In your `settings.py` file, ensure the `DEBUG` value is set to `False`.
   * Commit and push your changes (including the updated `requirements.txt` and `settings.py`) to your GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Configure WhiteNoise and prepare for deployment"
     git push
     ```

4. **Create a Heroku App:**
   Make sure you have the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) installed and are logged in.
   ```bash
   heroku create your-app-name
   ```

5. **Connect Heroku to GitHub:**
   * In your Heroku app dashboard, navigate to the `Deploy` tab.
   * Under `Deployment method`, click `GitHub` and connect your repository.

6. **Set Up Heroku Config Vars:**
   * In your Heroku app dashboard, go to `Settings` > `Reveal Config Vars`.
   * Add the following variables:
     * `DATABASE_URL`: The URL for your **Code Institute database**.
     * `CLOUDINARY_URL`: Your Cloudinary URL.
     * `SECRET_KEY`: Your Django secret key.
     * `HEROKU_HOSTNAME`: The hostname of your deployed Heroku app (e.g., `your-app-name.herokuapp.com`).

7. **Deploy and Run Migrations:**
   * On the `Deploy` tab, trigger a `Manual deploy` of the `main` branch.
   * Once the deploy is complete, run migrations:
   ```bash
   heroku run python manage.py migrate --app your-app-name
   ```
Your app should now be live.

## Future Features and Improvements

* **Payment Integration:** Integrate a payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal to handle rental payments directly through the website.
* **Advanced Search and Filtering:** Implement a search bar to find bikes by name and add more advanced filtering options, such as filtering by availability on a specific date.
* **User-to-User Messaging:** Create a simple messaging system to allow users to ask questions about a bike before renting.
* **Admin Dashboard Enhancements:** Improve the admin panel with more detailed analytics, such as rental statistics, popular bikes, and user activity reports.
* **Booking Calendar:** Instead of immediate rentals, allow users to book bikes for specific dates and times in the future using a calendar interface.
