# Bike Rental Project ðŸš²

This is a Django-based web application for a bike rental service. This project allows users to browse available bikes, rent them, and leave reviews. It also includes user authentication and a profile page for users to manage their rentals. This project was developed by a Code Institute student as a learning exercise.

## Project Features

* **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out. The application uses `django-allauth` for handling authentication.

* **Bike Listings**: A list of available bikes is displayed on the homepage. Users can sort the bikes by name, type, size, price, and rating.

* **Bike Details**: Each bike has a detail page with more information, including a description, its availability status, and user reviews.

* **User Profiles**: Each user has a profile page that displays their active rentals and rental history.

* **Rental System**: Authenticated users can rent available bikes. The system tracks active and past rentals.

* **Review and Rating System**: Users can leave reviews and ratings for bikes they have rented. The average rating for each bike is displayed on the bike listing and detail pages.

        string username
        string password
        string first_name
        string last_name
        string email
    }
    PROFILE {
        int id PK
        int user_id FK
        date date_of_birth
    }
    BIKE {

    }

    USER ||--o{ PROFILE : "has"
    USER ||--o{ RENTAL : "makes"
    USER ||--o{ REVIEW : "writes"
    BIKE ||--o{ RENTAL : "is rented in"
    BIKE ||--o{ REVIEW : "is reviewed in"
```

### Automated Testing

Automated tests are implemented using Django's built-in testing framework and Jest for frontend JavaScript.

* **Backend Tests**:
  * `reviews/tests.py`: Contains tests for the `Review` model and the `DeleteReview` view. These tests ensure that reviews are created correctly, that ratings are validated, and that users can delete their own reviews.
  * `rentals/tests.py`: Includes tests for the `create_rental` view. These tests verify that authenticated users can rent available bikes and that users with active rentals cannot rent another bike.

* **Frontend Tests**:
  * `static/js/star-rating.test.js`: Contains Jest tests for the star rating component on the review form. These tests ensure that the star rating functionality works as expected, including initialization, user interaction (clicking and hovering), and updating the hidden input value.

### Code Validation

#### Python Linter (Flake8)
All Python code was checked for errors and adherence to the PEP 8 style guide using the **Flake8** linter in Visual Studio Code. No errors were reported.

#### W3C Validators
The HTML and CSS files were validated to ensure they meet the latest web standards.
* **HTML:** All HTML pages were validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).
* **CSS:** The `style.css` file was validated using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

## Application Loading Speed

To ensure a good user experience, the application's loading speed was tested using the Chrome Lighthouse report.

## Deployment

### Local Setup

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository:**
   First, fork the [original repository](https://github.com/ihorsniezhko/bike-rental-project.git) to your own GitHub account. Then, clone your forked repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/bike-rental-project.git](https://github.com/your-username/bike-rental-project.git)
   cd bike-rental-project
   ```

2. **Create the Database:**
   Navigate to the [Code Institute database page](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/) to create your PostgreSQL database. You will receive the `DATABASE_URL` via email.

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   * Create a file named `env.py` in the root directory of the project.
   * Add `env.py` to your `.gitignore` file to ensure it's not committed to version control.
   * In `env.py`, add your secret variables:
     ```python
     import os
     
     os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "your-database-url-from-email")
     os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "your-own-strong-secret-key")
     os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "your-cloudinary-url")
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install all required packages from the `requirements.txt` file.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run Migrations and Create Superuser:**
   Apply the database migrations to create the necessary tables and create an admin user.
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Run the Application Locally:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Heroku Deployment

1.  **Install WhiteNoise:**
    WhiteNoise allows your application to serve its own static files in production.
    ```bash
    pip install whitenoise
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Update `settings.py` for Static Files:**
    In your `bike_rental/settings.py` file, make the following changes:
    * Add `whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware` to your `MIDDLEWARE` list, right after the `SecurityMiddleware`.
    * Define `STATIC_ROOT`.

    ```python
    # settings.py

    MIDDLEWARE = [
        'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
        'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',  # Add this line
        'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
        'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
        # ... other middleware
    ]

    # ... at the bottom of the file, with other static file settings
    STATIC_URL = '/static/'
    STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'), ]
    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
    ```

3. **Prepare for Deployment:**
   * In your `settings.py` file, ensure the `DEBUG` value is set to `False`.
   * Commit and push your changes (including the updated `requirements.txt` and `settings.py`) to your GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Configure WhiteNoise and prepare for deployment"
     git push
     ```

4. **Create a Heroku App:**
   Make sure you have the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) installed and are logged in.
   ```bash
   heroku create your-app-name
   ```

5. **Connect Heroku to GitHub:**
   * In your Heroku app dashboard, navigate to the `Deploy` tab.
   * Under `Deployment method`, click `GitHub` and connect your repository.

6. **Set Up Heroku Config Vars:**
   * In your Heroku app dashboard, go to `Settings` > `Reveal Config Vars`.
   * Add the following variables:
     * `DATABASE_URL`: The URL for your **Code Institute database**.
     * `CLOUDINARY_URL`: Your Cloudinary URL.
     * `SECRET_KEY`: Your Django secret key.
     * `HEROKU_HOSTNAME`: The hostname of your deployed Heroku app (e.g., `your-app-name.herokuapp.com`).

7. **Deploy and Run Migrations:**
   * On the `Deploy` tab, trigger a `Manual deploy` of the `main` branch.
   * Once the deploy is complete, run migrations:
   ```bash
   heroku run python manage.py migrate --app your-app-name
   ```
Your app should now be live.

## Future Features and Improvements

* **Payment Integration:** Integrate a payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal to handle rental payments directly through the website.
* **Advanced Search and Filtering:** Implement a search bar to find bikes by name and add more advanced filtering options, such as filtering by availability on a specific date.
* **User-to-User Messaging:** Create a simple messaging system to allow users to ask questions about a bike before renting.
* **Admin Dashboard Enhancements:** Improve the admin panel with more detailed analytics, such as rental statistics, popular bikes, and user activity reports.
* **Booking Calendar:** Instead of immediate rentals, allow users to book bikes for specific dates and times in the future using a calendar interface.
